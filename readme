Stupid app of generating infinite Fibonacci numbers - yes, we love Italy!

I don't really remember why I did this project.

### Build instruction
Follow gradle build procedure. The project uses wrapper so, just do

```
gradle assembleRelease
```
for release or

```
gradle assembleDebug
```
for debug. It will give you apks to run in simulator.

ohh, you have to have gradle installed.
